## Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecom company (Telco). Customer churn, or the loss of customers, is a critical concern for telecom companies as it impacts revenue and customer satisfaction. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain them and improve overall customer retention strategies. The project involves data analysis, machine learning model development, and evaluation using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Through feature engineering and model deployment, the project aims to provide actionable insights to reduce customer churn and enhance customer satisfaction in the telecom industry.

## Project Highlights

1. **Customer Churn Prediction**: This project is centered around forecasting customer churn within a telecommunications company (Telco). Anticipating customer churn is vital for telecom firms to mitigate customer attrition and refine their customer retention strategies.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: The project entails constructing and deploying a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether a customer is inclined to churn. This model leverages a variety of features including demographics, usage patterns, and customer behavior to make predictions.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The project includes a thorough evaluation of the predictive model using a range of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, ROC curves and AUC are utilized to gauge the model's efficacy in forecasting customer churn.

4. **Data Analysis**: The project involves an in-depth analysis of the Telco customer churn dataset to uncover patterns and insights that can enhance the predictive model. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to gain insights into the underlying characteristics of the dataset.
